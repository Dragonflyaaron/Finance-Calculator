# Capstone Project - Finance Calculator

## Description
For this project I had to assume I was approached by a small finicial company and asked to create a program.
The program allows a user to access two different finicial calculators.
An investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

To do this First I would create a menu to provide the user options within a while loop.
Making sure if the incorrect term is entered the loop would restart.
Create a nested while loop within the user chosen path,
this way if an accident does occur the information isn't lost, and it only loops back
one step.

Using the provided information from the user, have the program do the relevant calculations,
then display the information back to the user.
Ending by returning to the original menu.

## Project Usage
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my abilities to work on a large scale project.
To utilize various different methods to build out a programme from scratch.
This was part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp and to demonstate my capabilities.
